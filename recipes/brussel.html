        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Air fryer Brussels sprouts without bells and whistles, just delicious sprouts with crispy brown edges and soft insides. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I've got a 10-quart fryer; if the sprouts look crowded in your basket, make yours in two batches, putting the first cooked batch in a 170 degree F (75 degree C) oven to stay warm while you cook the second.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ pounds Brussels sprouts</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the air fryer is preheating, trim Brussels sprouts. Place in a bowl with olive oil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix well. Spread sprouts evenly in the air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 15 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through the cycle.</li>
        </ol>
